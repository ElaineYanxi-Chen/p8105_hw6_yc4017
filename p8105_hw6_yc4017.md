## Packages and settings

First we load the packages necessary to knit this document.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(mgcv)
library(modelr)
library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = TRUE,
    warning = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

set.seed(1)
```

## Problem 2: Homicides in Baltimore, MD

### Data Import

After loading the dataset, we want to do some initial cleaning and
tidying following these criteria below:

- We want to load the data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities.
- We want to create a `city_state` variable and a binary variable
  indicating whether the homicide is solved.
- Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO since they do
  not report victim race. Omit Tulsa, AL because this is a data entry
  mistake.
- We will limit the analysis for whom `victim_race` is `white` or
  `black`.
- Make sure that `victim_age` is a numeric variable.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ","),
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

### Baltimore, MD

We are interested in using the `glm` function to fit a logistic
regression model with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome, and victim
age, sex, and race as predictors.

To do so, we will first generate a dataset containing these variables
only.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% 
  select(resolved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Now we will run the logistic regression model using `glm` and save the
output as an R object.

``` r
fit_logistic = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) 
```

``` r
fit_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term             | log_OR |    OR | p.value |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)      |  1.152 | 3.164 |   0.000 |
| victim_age       | -0.007 | 0.993 |   0.043 |
| victim_sexMale   | -0.854 | 0.426 |   0.000 |
| victim_raceBlack | -0.842 | 0.431 |   0.000 |
